## What is this book about?
Dynamics 365 Business Central is a cloud-based SaaS ERP proposition from Microsoft. With development practices becoming more formal, implementing changes or new features is not as simple as it used to be back when Dynamics 365 Business Central was called Navigator, Navision Financials, or Microsoft Business Solutions-Navision, and the call for test automation is increasing. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the why and when of automated testing
* Discover how test-driven development can help to improve automated testing
* Explore the six pillars of the Testability Framework of Business Central
* Design and write automated tests for Business Central
* Make use of standard automated tests and their helper libraries
* Understand the challenges in testing features that interact with the external world
* Integrate automated tests into your development practice
