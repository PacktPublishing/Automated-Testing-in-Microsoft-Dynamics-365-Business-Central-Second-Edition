## What is this book about?
Dynamics 365 Business Central is a cloud-based SaaS ERP proposition from Microsoft. With development practices becoming more formal, implementing changes or new features is not as simple as it used to be back when Dynamics 365 Business Central was called Navigator, Navision Financials, or Microsoft Business Solutions-Navision, and the call for test automation is increasing. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the why and when of automated testing
* Discover how test-driven development can help to improve automated testing
* Explore the six pillars of the Testability Framework of Business Central
* Design and write automated tests for Business Central
* Make use of standard automated tests and their helper libraries
* Understand the challenges in testing features that interact with the external world
* Integrate automated tests into your development practice

## Get to Know the Author

In 1999, **Luc van Vugt** stepped into the Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC) world, training many developers. After Microsoft acquired Navision, he joined their Dynamics localization team as tester and project lead, 6 years closely involved with all BC releases. Since he left MS, he became an active community member with his blog, Dutch Dynamics Community and as conference speaker. He co-founded NAV Skills, supporting BC pros with workshops and webinars until 2019. He continues ever since with webinars under the flag of Areopa. For all this work, Luc has been awarded MS MVP since 2011. In 2012, he started fluxxus.nl mainly focusing on BC development courses and workshops on test automation, on the latter a main driving force in the community.
